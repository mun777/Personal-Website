            <h1>Service</h1>
            
            <p> Community service has been a huge part of my life through thick and thin. I have always dedicated myself to selfless service throughout 
                high school and into college. I have been involved in <a href="https://www.scouting.org/">Boy Scouts America</a> 
                as a kid and frequently many weekends would be dedicated to serving the community 
                through projects and helping with the small things. During the summer, I would volunteer to work at the nurse stations at the ICU unit at 
                <a href="https://www.stlukeshealth.org/locations/woodlands-hospital">St. Lukes's hospital</a>
                and my volunteer hours were the same times as full-time staff. I received the award for the most hours volunteered at 100 hours during the summer.
            </p>
            <p> In college, I volunteered through the Corps of Cadets in my freshman and sophomore years. The unit I was a part of,
                <a href="https://www.savagesixflyingtigers.com/">Savage Six</a> had a history of selfless 
                service after establishing itself in World War II by volunteering to go to China to fight off the Japanese invasion at the time. Therefore, as 
                a unit, we embody these traditions and carry out selfless service whenever needed. Such volunteer activities include talking to elderly home people 
                and service dog training for veterans. 
                Through this, I learned of the impact of what my actions can
                accomplish after seeing the smiles on people's faces. Every Thursday, we do a community service project in the afternoon.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another community service now includes organizing volunteer events and volunteering for my <a href="https://deltasig.org/">fraternity.</a>
                We conduct activities such as Kyle Field cleanup,
                The Big Event, Dog Days, Food Drive, and other events to support the local College Station community. Doing community service as an organization
                is a terrific way to get closer with fellow people in the organization and also have a meaningful message.I genuinely believe in the good of doing community 
                service and that the work I do through community service might have a meaningful impact. I just want to positively impact people and hopefully, it will spread
                and help create a more caring world.
